# Smart Tableâ€” an easy to use table/grid made with Angular and for Angular

This project is a lightweight table/grid builder. It is meant to be easy configurable but also easy customisable
(if you want to use it as a base for your own grid development). In The current version (0.1.0) the current features are

*table markup: it is a table and follows the semantic of an HTML table.
*manage your layout: you can choose the number of columns and how the should be mapped to your data model
*format data: you can choose how the data are formatted within a given column :
    ** by giving your own format function
    ** using one of the built-in angular filters
*Sort data
  **using your own algorithm
  **using the orderBy angular algorithm: in this case you'll be able to provide predicates as explained
     in orderBy filter documentation
*Filter data
    ** using a global search input box
    ** using the controller api to filter according to a particular column
*select data row(s) according to different modes:
    **single: one row selected at the time
    **multiple: many row selected at the time. In this case you can also add a selection column with checkboxes
*Simple style: you can easily give class name to all the cells of a given column and to the header as well
*template cell:
    ** you can provide template for a given column header (it will be compiled so that you can attach directves to it)
    ** same for the data cells
*Edit cells: you can make cells editable and specify a type for the input so that validation rules, etc will be applied
*Client side pagination : you can choose the number of rows you want to display and use the bootstrap directive to navigate.
*All the directives of the table use the table controller API. It means that you can easily change the templates and directives but still using
 the API to perform any operation

You'll find running example and more documentation at "fsdfsdfsdf"

## How to use Smart-Table

*You can clone the repository: the source code will be under smart-table-module directory.
*You can add the Smart-Table.debug.js file to your application and then add the module 'SmartTable.Table' to your own app module.
Note that for the moment the build does not inject the templates in the TemplateCache, so you'll also have to add the template files that you can
find in the smart-table-module/partials directory (if you use another directories layout don't forget to change the paths in the source code)

### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Note that you'll find a running example app at http://localhost:<port>/example-app/index.html to see the app running in
your browser.

### Running unit tests

Tests can be run with Testacular: you'll find the config file under config folder. Note, the coverage is done by Istanbul

See Testacular website for more information


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.
